# Python Library Numpy
## Task 1
1. Data file is recipes.csv. link : https://github.com/Nimra064/Numpy-Task/blob/master/NumpyTask1/recipes.csv  <br>
2. Attached with jupyter notebook <br>
3. All of Alize’s recipes call for milk, eggs, sugar, flour, and butter. For example, her cupcake recipe calls for: <br>
Flour Sugar Eggs Milk Butter 2 cups 0.75 cups 2 eggs 1 cups 0.5 cups Create a NumPy array that represents this data. Each element should be a number (i.e., 2 for “2 cups”). Save this array as cupcakes.<br>
3. Alize’s assistant has compiled all of her recipes into a csv (comma-separated variable) file called recipes.csv. Load this file into a variable called recipes.<br>
Display recipes using print. Display recipes using print.<br>
4. Each row represents a different recipe. Each column represents a different ingredient.<br>
5. Recipe Cups of Flour Cups of Sugar Eggs Cups of Milk Cups of Butter<br>

Cupcakes … … … … … <br>

Pancake … … … … … <br>

Cookie … … … … … <br>

Bread … … … … … <br>
6. The 3rd column represents the number of eggs that each recipe needs. <br>
7. Which recipes require exactly 1 egg? Use a logical statement to get True or False for each value of eggs. <br>
8. Alize is going to make 2 batches of cupcakes (1st row) and 1 batch of cookies (3rd row). <br>
9. Get the number of ingredients for a double batch of cupcakes by using multiplication on cupcakes. Save your new variable to double_batch. <br>
10. Create a new variable called grocery_list by adding cookies and double_batch. <br>
